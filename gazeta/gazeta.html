                <div>
                    <p class="by">By ROBERT PEAR</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON — About 6.4 million people have signed up for health insurance next year under the Affordable
                    Care Act, the Obama administration said Wednesday, as people rushed to purchase plans regardless of Republican
                        promises that the law will be repealed within months.</p>
                    <p>The new sign-ups — an increase of 400,000 over a similar point last year — mean the health care coverage
                    of millions of consumers could be imperiled by one of the first legislative actions of Donald J. Trump’s
                    presidency. Hundreds of thousands of other people who took no action will be automatically re-enrolled by
                    the federal government in the same or similar plans, officials said, and their coverage could be threatened
                        as well. Consumers still have until the end of January to enroll.</p>
                    <p>Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said the number of signups was remarkable
                    in view of “headwinds” created by premium increases for 2017 and by the uncertainty of the entire health law
                        after Mr. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.</p>
                    <p>Americans remain divided over President Obama’s most significant legislative achievement, even as 20 million
                    people have gained coverage under the law and the percentage of those without insurance has dropped to record
                    lows. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders of the House and the Senate have vowed to repeal the 2010 law as one of
                        the first legislative actions of the Trump era.</p>
                    <p>To lay the political groundwork, Republicans have portrayed the law as collapsing under its own weight,
                        unable to hold down health costs or provide the insur</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON — Eric Trump said on Wednesday that he had decided to stop directly soliciting contributions
                                for his charitable foundation, which supports causes like the fight against childhood cancer, because he
                                now recognizes that his status as the president-elect’s son means that donors could try to use him to gain
                                access to his father.</p>

                            <p>His move followed public criticism of an online auction that the Eric Trump Foundation had sponsored offering
                                a chance to have coffee with his sister Ivanka. The criticism intensified over the weekend after an invitation
                                was drafted offering a hunting trip with Eric Trump or his brother Donald Jr. in exchange for donations of $500,000
                                or $1 million to a new charity that friends of Eric Trump had created this month with his apparent consent, according to legal documents.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON — Presidentelect Donald J. Trump seemed to suggest on Wednesday that the deadly truck attack
                                on a Christmas market in Berlin vindicated his proposal during the presidential campaign to bar Muslims
                                from entering the United States.</p>
                            <p><q>You know my plans,</q> Mr. Trump said to reporters who asked whether the attack on Monday, in which a Tunisian
                                is being sought, would cause him to reevaluate his proposals to create a Muslim registry or to stop Muslim
                                immigration to the United States. <q>All along, I’ve been proven to be right. One hundred percent correct.</q></p>
                            <p>It was not clear whether Mr. Trump was reaffirming his muchcriticized call for a wholesale ban on Muslim
                                immigration or his subsequent clarification that he would stop only those entering from countries with
                                a history of Islamic extremism. As with many of his pronouncements since his election last month, the
                                remarks, delivered on the blustery front steps of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, were cryptic and
                                left room for broad interpretation</p>
                            <p>But hours later, one of his advisers said he was only restating his most recent position.</p>

                    <p>BERLIN — Searching the cab of the tractor-trailer that plowed through a Christmas market in Berlin,
                    the authorities made two startling discoveries: a badly bruised body with stab and gunshot wounds,
                        and the wallet of a Tunisian labeled a security threat who was supposed to have been deported months ago.</p>
                    <p>The identity of the Tunisian, Anis Amri, immediately alarmed intelligence officials from Europe to Washington.
                    German officials acknowledged that Mr. Amri was known to have links to a radical Salafist preacher and had been
                    in their custody pending deportation proceedings after being caught with fake papers. He was freed, even though
                        he was considered potentially dangerous by the authorities.</p>

                    Messenger, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the investigation. He was also
                        on a United States no-fly list, the officials said on Wednesday evening.</p>
